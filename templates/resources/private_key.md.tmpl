{{ .Description | trimspace }}

~> **Security Notice** The private key generated by this resource will
be stored *unencrypted* in your Terraform state file.

This is a *logical resource*, contributing only to the current Terraform
state without creating any external managed resources.


## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/x25519_private_key/resource.tf" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Generating a New Key

Since a private key is a logical resource that resides solely in the Terraform state,
it persists until explicitly destroyed by the user.

To force the generation of a new key within an existing state, taint the
private key instance:

```bash
terraform taint x25519_private_key.example
```
